This app enables you to search for hotels, attractions and restaurants and displays them on a google map. You can click the places and the relevant place will come into view on the place details on the left.
There is a search bar on the top right to change the current location
You can filter the places according to rating

I use apis from rapidAPI and google maps
https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/
https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/

make sure to change the google places API key in the html file where google maps script in inserted.

Add a .env file with the relevant API keys used in the Map.js and index.js of the API file
